# reinforcement-learning-material-ws-2018
This repository collects supplementary material to study reinforcement learning with a focus on topics covered by the TU Darmstadt IAS lecture on reinforcement learning.

The repository is structured by topics and is basically a collection of ressources which explain or highlight different algorithms and theories covered in the lecture. All material should be categorized into four different tiers: introductory light reading (i.e. medium posts, non-scientific tutorials), research papers (preferably with arxiv links), textbooks (only if they are available via ULB Darmstadt) and code examples.

## Materials by topic

### Background and general foundations

- [TUTORIAL] Matrix cookbook: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf
  - All the pesky matrix and vector gradients, but only useful as a cheatsheet, not as an accessible introduction.
- [TUTORIAL] Lagrangian quickly explained (argmin blog): http://www.argmin.net/2016/05/31/mechanics-of-lagrangians/
  - A very nice and painless intro to lagrangian optimization. Interestingly, you can even derive backprop via lagrangian methods http://www.argmin.net/2016/05/18/mates-of-costate/

### Foundations of MDP and reinforcement learning

- [BOOK] THE Sutton book http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf
  - Very good for the intuition, slightly less mathy then Jan Peter's general approach
- [TUTORIAL] arg min blog: http://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/
  - Very detailed in depth tour through reinforcement learning from a strong optimization point of view. Highly opinionated at times, but incredibly interesting. Specific highlights include
   an LQR introduction http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/, a brutal takedown of policy gradient (not necessarily true, but very interesting nonetheless) 
   http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/26/nominal/, a PID control introduction for those who slept through CER http://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/
- [Tutorial] Jonathan Hui's RL Series. Accessable, explains background.: https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-deep-reinforcement-learning-series-833319a95530

### Policy and value iteration

- [PAPER] Approximate Dynamic Programming with GP: http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/DeiPetRas08.pdf
  - Jan's paper on Dynamic Programming using Gaussian Processes. Discusses dynamic programming shortly and highlights some of the challenges of state space discretization.

### LQR and classical control


### Temporal difference learning and function approximation

- [PAPER] LSPI introduction paper: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v4/lagoudakis03a.html<Paste>
  - This paper introduces LSPI and gives a tour de force of value function approximation with a strong focus on 
   really explaining projection in value function approximation.
- [PAPER] DQN Nature Paper: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf
  - This paper gives a good overview of the DQN algorithm as used in he seminal atari video game breakthrough.

### POMDP and filtering

- [PAPER] POMDP introduction paper: https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/papers/aij98-pomdp.pdf
  - Leslie Kaelbling's seminal POMDP introduction paper, highlighting a lot of the aspects of the POMDP setting

### Policy Gradient methods

- [PAPER] REINFORCE paper: http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf
  - The paper introduces the REINFORCE algorithm and gives an introduction to the foundations of policy gradient.
- [PAPER] Natural Gradient paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02660.pdf
  - Gives an introduction to natural gradients, but doesn't highlight the derivation or the intuition in detail.
- [PAPER] Natural evolution strategies: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/wierstra14a/wierstra14a.pdf
  - To be honest, I didn't read it yet
-  [TUTORIAL] Policy Gradient explained accessible, good start without the complete math. https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-policy-gradients-explained-9b13b688b146
- [Lecture] Policy Search by Pieter Abbeel. Likelihood Ratio Policy Gradient, REINFORCE, Baseline,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEHyTBJ1pSc (slides here: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/nips-tutorial-policy-optimization-Schulman-Abbeel.pdf )
